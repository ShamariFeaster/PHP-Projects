This is a twitter data mining bot I wrote back in 2010 before twitter switched
to OAuth s the sode surretly will not work because I haven't converted it to
OAuth login but with that mod I think it should still work.

Here's what it does:

it allows the user to pick a search term and then it scours twitter for people
who have used that term in a tweet with a certain time frame, the last 5
minutes for example. It also only targets people who have used that term
in a tweet that has an "@" in it, implying they are currently engaged
in a conversation with someone and are more likely to check their inbox
 and see the tweet this bot will send to them.

An example usage is if you are trying to get the word out about a cell phone
repair business you could target "lost|broke|missing phone" and the tweet
you send them could say "I just lost my phone too, but I got this one <link>"

I'm not sure how the culture and mechanics of twitter has changed since I 
wrote this ware but I'm sure it could be updated to still be useful today.
